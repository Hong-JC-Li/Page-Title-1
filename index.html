        <button class="button">The text just below is false, don't click it, and in addition, click ME!</button>

        <p class="br">U are confused right? Click me. This is your first clue. But click this line, for real. You'll regret clicking the top ones right now.</p>
        <p class="o"> Keep in mind that you should never click anything unless a clue leads you to click it.</p>
        <p class="hr">Always trust your instinct, so click the button!</p>
        <p class="hs">It doesn't do anything, huh?</p>
        <p class="s">Don't just stand around, click the treasure! I'm going to give you a while to figure out what this means.</p>
        <img class="vv" src="http://personal.psu.edu/xqz5228/jpg.jpg">
        <p class="vc">Now double click the button twice to get the treasure!</p>
        <h1 class="cv">Be patient breh, you probably thought that it ended right there. Would have given me a low score, eh? Well, click the image to progress further.</h1>
